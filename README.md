Blender GIS
==========
A new version for Blender 2.80 beta is already available in the dedicated branch.
Until official 2.8 release, the master branch is for Blender 2.79 only.

[FAQ](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/FAQ) - [Quick start guide](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Quick-start)


[Basemaps](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Basemaps)
--------------------
Display web map service like OpenStreetMap directly in Blender

[SRTM download](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/SRTM)
--------------------
Get SRTM topographic data and apply it as height texture

[ESRI Shapefile import / export](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Shapefile-import)
--------------------

A [Shapefile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system software.

This tool can import into Blender most of shapefile feature type. It can also uses attributes data to define Z elevation values or Z extrusion values.

Exporter script can export a mesh to pointZ, polylineZ or polygonZ shapefile. Note that currently this tool does not re-export attribute data include in the dbase file linked to the shapefile. So if you want to import a shapefile for edit it into Blender and then re-export it, you will lose attribute data.


[Georeferenced raster importer](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Import-georef-raster)
--------------------

Import geotiff or common image format georeferenced with a [world file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_file).

You can import the raster as a plane mesh, as backgound image for orthographic view, as UV texture mapping on a mesh or [as DEM](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Import-DEM-grid) for warp a mesh with the displace modifier.

ESRI ASCII GRID format is also supported through a dedicated import tool.

[OpenStreetMap import](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/OSM-import)
--------------------

[Georeferenced render output](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Make-a-georef-render)
--------------------

This is a tool to create a new camera correctly setup for produce a map render. Georeferencing data (worldfile) are writing in text file accessible from the Blender text editor.


[Delaunay triangulation & Voronoi diagram](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Make-terrain-mesh-with-Delaunay-triangulation)
--------------------

This script computes [Delaunay triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) in 2.5D. This triangulation is suitable for create a 3D terrain mesh from [points cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud) or [contour lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_line)

The script can also compute [Voronoi tessellation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi) in 2D which is the dual of delaunay triangulation. Voronoi diagram is suitable to make neighborhood analysis map.


[Terrain analysis](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Terrain-analysis)
--------------------

This part of Blender GIS is designed to assist in the analysis of the topography : height, slope and azimuth (aspect).

There are 2 tools, one to build materials nodes setup for Cycles engine, and a second to configure the color ramp as usual in common GIS software (reclassify values and apply color ramp presets).

[Georeferencing management](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS/wiki/Gereferencing-management)
--------------------
Handle various projection systems with reprojection capabilities and compatibility with some others addons
